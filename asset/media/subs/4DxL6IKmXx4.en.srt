1
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,800
”Goodbye” and ”Thank you” at the top of my voice

2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:38,100
What's more important than grief

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,700
Hoping that they reach you as we part

4
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,300
In time for the warmth and pain

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,900
I thought it would always be like this

6
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,000
I envisioned our days to come

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,500
Why, when our lights calling out to each other

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,100
Still burn deep in our hearts?

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,800
We met amidst a blazing journey

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,300
Coming together, then letting go for the sake of the future

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,100
Every time a dream comes true, I’ll remember you

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Wishing to become stronger, I cried
 with my resolve as the parting gift

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Held captive by nostalgic memories

14
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,800
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,600
There will be even more as I grow older

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I never want to lose anything again

17
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,600
By succumbing to the grief

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,300
I might not feel pain anymore 

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,600
But your words, your wishes

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,200
I swore to protect them to the end

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,900
With a roar, it's crumbling down

22
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

23
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,600
The bundle of bursting light that I reached out for and held so close 

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,500
Shimmered, then disappeared for the sake of the future

25
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:52,000
Going beyond the happiness and promises I've been entrusted 

26
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,400
I’ll keep moving forward without glancing behind

27
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,300
Looking straight ahead, I’m going to cry out

28
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,900
Lighting the flames in my heart

29
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Until I reach that distant future…
