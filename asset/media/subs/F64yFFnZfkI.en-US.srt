00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,660

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,580
You see,​

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,820
I’ve actually realized already​

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,740
Look, about that thing you said​

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,140
I didn’t feel like​

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,480
Thinking about it too much​

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,440
So I had forgotten about it, but​

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,460
Living blindly, recklessly, delusionally​

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,080
Impulsively, impatiently, negatively 
didn’t do me any good​

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,180
I’m sure​

15
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:06,883
That on the last day of my life,
when I think of what’s gone before​

16
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:11,076
All of it, all of it will be unspeakably precious, but​

17
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:12,269
Ah,

18
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,450
On that last day of my life, 
you won’t be there

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,300
More, more, more​

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,580
Say that more clearly​

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,140
You see,​

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,320
I’m not sure how to tell you

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
That the sky is blue

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,720
Or what

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,280
I’d have to do to make you understand

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,980
That the clouds at night are high

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
Say it

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,640
You see,

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,300
I actually know

30
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,480
That you're already gone

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,380
You see,

32
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,880
You'll probably just call me obstinate

33
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,000
And I want to forget, but

34
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,460
Say it more clearly

35
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,160
Make a note so you won't forget it

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,620
Let's meet tomorrow at ten on the
 train platform, or something like that

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,280
Even if its petals scatter, 
a peony is still a flower

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,820
Even if summer ends, the memories 
of it are still cherished

39
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,520
Put it into words, give voice to it

40
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,760
Say it

41
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:21,460
And then if I could see you 
on the last day of my life

42
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,298
I'm sure,

43
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:26,900
Even on the last day of my life,
 that I'd sing of love

44
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,400
Because you'd tell me none of it,
 none of it was in vain

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,117
Ah,

46
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:37,556
I still can't believe that 
on the last day of my life,

47
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:40,360
You won't be here

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,320
More, more, more, more

49
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,580
More, more, more, you have to

50
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,860
More, more, more, more

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,120
Please,

52
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,400
Say it,

53
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,940
More clearly

54
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,320
