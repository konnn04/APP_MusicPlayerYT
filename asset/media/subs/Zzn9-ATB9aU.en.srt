1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,740
Darling, ever since the smile you dropped found
its way into my heart

2
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,560
has it ever crossed your mind that you would
wait

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,920
and give me all your naivety unconditionally?

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,240
I, someone who always sings about far-fetched
things

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,680
roams around to find the joys I missed

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,320
and never bothers to remind myself to forget all
the uncertainties.

7
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,640
Our love is full of wistfulness expressed in the
letters just written with fresh inkblots.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,820
It wasn’t our fault to turn a deaf ear to the
heart’s order.

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
It’s a pity that…

10
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,560
You are no longer my muse.

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,560
I am no longer the dreamy musician, too.

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,660
Featherlight as this love is

13
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,900
it has loaded my heart with scars.

14
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,300
The love I sang about is vulnerable

15
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,560
so I might as well let go of it

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,700
and put aside our tender days

17
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,340
to return them…

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,880
Darling, you will soon forget our tender days

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,340
I just hope that you will keep our memories in your heart

20
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,700
and hope that you won’t have to shoulder any sadness

21
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,920
Tomorrow, as you start walking on your own spacious path of life

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,760
Just bear in mind

23
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,120
There is someone who used to love you to infinity and beyond.

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
You are no longer my muse.

25
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I am no longer the dreamy musician, too.

26
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,200
Featherlight as this love is

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,700
it has loaded my heart with scars.

28
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,880
The love I sang about is vulnerable

29
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,160
so I might as well let go of it

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,200
and put aside our tender days

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,260
to give them all back..

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,180
to you.

33
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,740
You are no longer my muse.

34
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,160
I am no longer the dreamy musician, too

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,880
Featherlight as this love is

36
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,800
it has loaded my heart with scars.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,540
The love I sang about is vulnerable

38
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,860
so I might as well let go of it

39
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,020
and put aside our tender days

40
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,920
to give them all back....

41
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,440
... to you

42
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:16,403
