akiramenai de ikiro yo."
"Live on without giving up!"

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,060
sonna uta ga tadashii nante, bakageteru yo na.
It is ridiculous to say that songs
with that kind of lyrics are correct

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,720
jissai jibun wa shinde mo yokute
To be honest, I wouldn't care at all if I died,

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,500
mawari ga shindara kanashikute
But I'd be pretty sad if the people around me did,

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,200
"sore ga iya dakara" tte iu, ego nan desu.
I suppose it's some kind of ego, that goes:
"Because I just wouldn't like it."

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,480
tanin ga ikite mo dou demo yokute 
Having no care whatsoever whether
strangers live or not,

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,280
dareka o kirau koto mo fasshon de
And hating someone else just seems like
some kind of fashion now,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
soredemo "heiwa ni ikiyou" nante
But “Live peacefully” nevertheless?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,840
suteki na koto deshou.
What a wonderful thing that would be indeed...

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,680
gamen no saki de wa dareka ga shinde
On the other side of the screen, someone dies,

16

Lamenting that someone else sings,

17

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,300
itsumo dareka o koroshitai uta o
We so very simply broadcast songs about

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,820
kantan ni denpa de nagashita.
Wanting to kill somebody over radio waves

23

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920

Since I’ve got no money, again,
I enjoy sleeps of idleness throughout the day

Still without grasping the meaning of life, I come to an epiphany that it’s pointless and so I take a breath.

29

sabishii nante kotoba de kono kizu ga arawasete ii mono ka
Is is really OK to express this wound with the words,
“I’m lonely”?

00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,840
sonna iji bakari kakae kyou mo hitori beddo ni nemuru
Carrying nothing else but such obstinacy,
today I sleep alone on my bed again

isshou shinazu ni ikite iku.
