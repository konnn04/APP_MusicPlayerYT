1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,120
YOUR LIE IN APRIL

2
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,160
The spring with you seems like it hasn't started yet,

3
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,100
and the blowing wind softly caresses the falling petals

4
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,600
You've stepped towards me just like how you used to

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,100
run away with me on the green field

6
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,620
The song's melody with the evening sunlight gently brought us together forever

7
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,600
Faintly whispered all the honest things we had kept in our hearts

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:39,000
All these long roads made us exhausted, and we once fell

9
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,400
April you were here looking at me smiling

10
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,600
The petals wither too quickly, you had flown away, you had gone far away

11
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,640
April is sometimes too fragile for us to say all the words in our heart

12
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,800
If only I had trusted you for once,

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,580
the girl I loved now has gone with the winds

14
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:15,160
Leaving April there...

15
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,500
The spring without you seems to have started

16
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,900
And the blowing wind unwittingly sweeps away the falling petals

17
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,500
You hastily hid away under the evening sun rays

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,820
Leaving only footprints on the vast green field

19
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:08,000
The quiet melody in the middle of a late afternoon brought us closer forever

20
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,140
Faintly whispered all the honest things we had kept in our hearts

21
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,460
All these long roads make me exhausted, I have fallen once

22
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,800
April starlight suddenly fades away in the distant

23
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:36,660
The petals wither too quickly, you had flown away, you had gone away

24
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,440
April is sometimes too fragile for us to say all the words in our heart

25
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,000
If only I had trusted you for once,

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the girl I loved now has gone with the winds

27
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,040
Leaving April there...

28
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,200
And I will live like what you used to dream of

29
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,040
And I will step forward on the road I'd chosen

30
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,720
And when I die will smile to see you

31
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,480
Gently greet my April girl...

32
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,240
All the memories fade too quickly, you had flown away, you had gone far away

33
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,660
April is sometimes too fragile for us to say...

34
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,200
If only I had trusted you for once,

35
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,700
the girl I loved now has gone with the winds

36
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Leaving April forever...

37
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:44,160
Leaving April to myself...
