1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,970
I don't like you because you're cool

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,683
You're cool because I like you

3
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:09,798
It doesn't matter if others make fun of you

4
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:12,817
You're my hero, after all

5
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:15,547
Like how you say you're sleepy

6
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:18,244
Yet you're always awake for class

7
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:20,999
You act cool in front of others

8
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,075
But are a big mush in front of dogs

9
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:29,317
Ah, you're the one I really love

10
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:36,015
Please be a hero just for me

11
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,976
I want to message you on LINE

12
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,885
I want to walk home together

13
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:44,774
As you go off to your after-school club

14
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:47,679
"See you later," I say to myself

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,416
I want to see you on weekends

16
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,503
And fall asleep on the phone with you

17
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:56,435
But I don't have the courage

18
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,734
I really hate this

19
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:02,285
I want you to turn around and see me

20
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:05,934
I want you to think of me

21
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,823
I put on perfume

22
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:10,959
And choke on the scent

23
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,943
I want you so much

24
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:17,537
And I want to be yours

25
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:20,072
"Tomorrow will be the day," I say

26
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:23,162
Fantasizing on my bed

27
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:25,501
While thinking of you

28
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,468
See you tomorrow

29
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,815
I don't like you because you're cute

30
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,711
You're cute because I like you

31
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,793
It doesn't matter if others make fun of you

32
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:51,495
You're my heroine, after all

33
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:54,442
Like how you say you'll stay awake today

34
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,150
Yet always fall asleep in class

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,266
How you act like a tomboy in front of everyone

36
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:03,050
Yet cry surprisingly easily

37
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,441
Ah, you're the one I really love

38
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:14,637
Won't you be a heroine just for me?

39
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,739
I want to help you with your studies

40
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,820
I want to go see movies together

41
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,708
As you're laughing with friends after class

42
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,390
I say,  "Bye" to myself

43
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,019
I want to be in your story

44
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,465
I want to brag saying, "She's my girlfriend"

45
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:35,359
But I don't think I can confess

46
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,525
I really hate this

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,168
I want you to turn around and see me

48
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:44,854
I want you to think of me

49
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:47,321
I put wax in my hair

50
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,893
And get all sticky

51
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:52,776
I want you so much

52
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:56,447
And I want to be yours

53
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:59,005
"Tomorrow will be the day," I say

54
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,062
Fantasizing in my futon

55
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,463
While thinking of you

56
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:07,316
See you tomorrow

57
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:33,503
I asked you for advice about you

58
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:39,399
You asked me for advice about a boy

59
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:44,495
Don't tell me to give up

60
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:47,384
Don't go to another boy

61
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:50,355
Always keep your eyes on me

62
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:55,404
I want you to turn around and see me

63
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:58,978
I want you to think of me

64
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:04,115
Won't you stay by my side forever?

65
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:08,973
I really love you

66
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:16,441
I absolutely adore you

67
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:19,305
"Tomorrow will be the day," I say

68
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:22,099
I'm fantasizing again today

69
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,010
My love for you

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,379
Smelled of sweet musk
