00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,740
ウォルピスカーター  - Blooming in the Mud 泥中に咲く (English lyrics)

2
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,780
Unable to filter the pieces of our broken hearts,

3
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,740
our tears gently dried up,

4
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,760
unable to shed another drop.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,120
“That's funny, isn't it?” we laugh...

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,940
A difficult life, maze-like brambles that obstruct you.

7
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,860
The darkness of this corrupt world blocks your path.

8
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,920
You’re someone who’s more depressed than anyone else.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,340
So, right now, we’re probably on the verge of drowning

10
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,080
saved by breathing correctly

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,000
now, we simply live for the sake of dying someday.

12
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,180
When we realise why we dislike rain

13
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,700
deep down, we remember

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,860
that large soap bubbles

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,880
must be really soft and fluffy.

16
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,640
While looking at every colors on the ground

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,480
we make sure to walk where there are no puddles.

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,520
Surely, you too, would resort to self-defence

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,340
if you could avoid a difficult path.

20
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,680
Right now, I am human; today, tomorrow too, and the day after that

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
it's enough to admit it,

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,380
everyone takes in different breaths.

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,760
But you too are human,

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,040
you just hate being one, that's all.

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,060
But you can't hate it, because you're a kind person, you're that someone who would pray for just about anyone.

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,940
It takes, for a single blossom to scatter,

27
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,100
water, earth, sunlight and its own seed

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,400
Whatever lies right in front of me,

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,540
its meaning, past and future,

30
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,380
if a single one of those were missing, nothing would be born: not me, not you, and neither that person.

31
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,980
“It’s nothing” - I say as I burden you with my past.

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,300
Destiny getting in your way.

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,600
is a misunderstanding. You reap what you sow.

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,600
But because this situation is unpleasant,

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,140
you want to run away, right?

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,280
You want to live, right?

37
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,800
If there is a moment when you feel like throwing yourself,

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,560
cleave through the darkness of this world, and let us search for the reason you were born.

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,980
The beginning at the end, once it begins, it will be your final life,

40
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,920
at the end of an endless journey, there must be a “time” where it’s now or never.

41
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,360
“It’s impossible to drown in the rain”,

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,080
even so, it feels like it’s hard to breathe.

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,200
“We live for the sake of dying someday”,

44
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,740
if that is so, if that is so,

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,620
we'll never break again. Never. Never. Never

46
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,960
Let the unbroken bells of our hearts resound

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,480
everything will be covered by dark clouds and smeared with mud.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,300
Let us draw a line inside the maze that obstructs the path of the world now.

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,220
This line will be the overlapping map:

50
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,800
the flower that blooms for the sake of illuminating you.
